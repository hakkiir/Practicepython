#This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise
#(see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.
#Take two lists, say for example these two:
	#a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	#b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
#and write a program that returns a list that contains only the
#elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
#Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
import random

a = random.sample(range(99), 20)
b = random.sample(range(75), 15)

commons = [i for i in a for x in b if i == x]
c = []
d = [c.append(i) for i in commons if i not in c]

print(c)
